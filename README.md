# OperatingSystems
- The aims of this course are:  
- to introduce the students to the basic concepts and abstraction models for Operating Systems; 
- to show the range of algorithms and methodologies available for specific problems in an Operating System,the implications of selecting specific algorithms, and to critically assess their performance and behaviour; 
- to develop an integrated understanding of what a computing machine and resource is performing,from a holistic view of hardware and software; 
- to convey knowledge of the family of algorithms dealing with: scheduling, process management, synchronisation, parallelism, networking and key advances in operating systems.
